<!-- 
Sure, here's a basic outline of how you can implement the Attendance Management System:

Teacher's side (JSP page):

Create a form that allows the teacher to enter the subject name, date, class name, and location.
Generate a unique code (you can use the java.util.UUID class for this) and associate it with the entered information.
Store the code and the associated information in a database table (e.g., attendance_codes).
Display the code to the teacher.


Student's side (JSP page):

Create a form that allows the student to enter the code provided by the teacher.
Retrieve the information associated with the code from the database table.
Check if the student's location matches the location associated with the code.
If the code is valid and the location matches, mark the student as present in the attendance table.
